## I love to code.
I code a lot. I have to preface this. The reason why I code a lot, but there are very little repositories in my github is because most of them are "Private" codes, and most of them are websites. I love making websites. I have multiple web portfolios before this, focusing mostly on the design aesthetics. I did not use any CSS frameworks on those websites. Once I finished a website, I had to make it responsive. It was hard for me because I used "broken grid" concept a lot on my website. But I never learn from that mistake, I repeatedly make web portfolios with that concept.

## I play video games.
I have been play Defense of the Ancient (DotA) since 2010. I played it with my brothers and my friends until this very moment. In DotA 2 (2012 - Present), you can see how much have you played the game, it says 4100+ hours. 

Another genre I like to play is called FPS or First Person Shooting. Games like Counter Strike, Overwatch, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Valorant are FPS games that I played. It sharpens my reflexes and mouse accuracy which helps me to code faster and better :) 

## I hoop.
I played basketball since I was 10 years old. I got ice in my veins.
