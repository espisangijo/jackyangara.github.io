# About Me

I first learned how to code during high school when I had to choose an elective between Biology, Economics, and Computing.
It was a no-brainer for me, considering the other two did not fascinate me as much.
It was sort of fun, learning how technologies work. I got an A for my GCE A Level Computing examination, and also Mathematics.

Then, when I got into university, I took Computing again as my major. But I was never a hard-working student.
I took things lightly and 6 semesters flew by. I averaged 2.9/4.0 for 6 semesters. 

And that was when, I decided to change.
You see, life is not that simple. If the "past" me thought that I would get a job easily, he was wrong. (too dramatic)
I then worked so hard for the last 2 semesters and averaged 3.85/4.0. It was enough to lift my GPA to 3.1, and I graduated with Second Honour Division I (very close to being Division II).

During that period, it was job hunting season. I was offered internships from 2 companies (1 in Japan, 1 in Singapore), and 1 full-time job (in Hong Kong). All of them are for Data Science. However, 2019 was rough for Hong Kong, my parents want me to go somewhere else. 

I wanted Japan. I love Japan. 日本が大好きです。 寿司、刺身、丼。But Singapore is close to home. I can go back to Indonesia on weekends. People in Singapore can speak English (one of the best deciding factor). I had to go to Singapore.

I worked as a Data Science Intern in Shopee, an giant e-commerce company in South East Asia, and it was awesome. I like it there. I then convert to a full-time employee, working as a Data Scientist in Language Service team (the best team in the world).
