## Financial News Analytics
###### Aug '18 – Apr '19
Developed a hybrid sentiment analyzer using Naïve Bayes classifier and recurrent neural network.
The intuition behind using a hybrid sentiment analyzer is to overcome the sentiment from opinionated words.
These words may not be useful in determining the overall sentiment of a sentence.
This classic approach uses chi-square distribution to decide which word goes to the NB classifier or the RNN.

Incorporated technical analysis into the prediction model to penalize fluctuations. 
Two methods were included, Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Candlestick Pattern Recognition (CPR).
CPR is a treshold-based feature where a function decides what candlestick pattern is shown in a given day.
EMA is used to normalize the sentiment analyzer by penalizing the prediction made by the sentiment analyzer.
This two techniques minimizes the Root-mean-squared error on the prediction.

Crawled news data from different sources as training data for the RNN.
Using the text as a feature, I then compare it to 4 different labels.
The labels are the sentiment on that same day (i.e. close on day _d_ > open on day _d_ = positive) or the next day (i.e. close on day _d + 1_ > open on day _d_ = positive), up until the next 3 days.
The experiment concluded that using the next 2 days was the better label for the features.

Nominated for “Best Final Year Project” award. However, I could not attend the competition because I had to fly to Singapore on the same day.

Encouraged by department to compete in "HKEIA Innovation & Technology Project Competition Award 2019".

## Avocado Price Analysis
###### Aug '18 – Nov '18

Discovered strong correlations between data using multivariate data analysis. Avocado sales being very high in certain areas near the coasts while being very low in the center.

Applied and offered a “Research Assistant” role on the topic of natural language processing. 

## Coauthorship Network Analysis
###### Aug '18 – Nov '18

Learned relationships between different nodes and how to assess different relationships in a network. Used some mathematical functions to express the centeredness, relationships and degrees of seperations of each nodes in the graph.
