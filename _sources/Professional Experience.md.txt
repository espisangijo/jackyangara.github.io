# Professional Experience

## Shopee
### Associate Data Scientist
###### Sep '19 – Present
Fine-tuned a pre-trained model (BERT) to perform sentiment analysis on noisy structured data. Created a preprocessing pipeline to clean the noisy data. Prepared a text labelling guideline for local teams to label the data accordingly.

Performed data clustering on noisy text data to assist a slot-filling task. Analysed the multi-dimensional data to find the optimum amount of clusters using mathematical methods. Implemented active learning to overcome the problem faced by unsupervised learning.

Experimented on different word/sentence embeddings (e.g. BERT embedding, fastText embedding, word2vec, GloVe, TF-IDF) to compare the weaknesses and strengths in different tasks of NLP.

Researched on different python web frameworks to find one that suits the application. Developed and deployed APIs using falcon web framework which consistently performs really well on high load.

Crawled data from online sources using multiprocessing on multiple proxies while maintaining low number of HTTP request to prevent web traffic disruption.

Performed unit testing (Python's unittest and PyTest) and load testing (JMeter) on APIs before entering UAT and Live deployment.

Application of various machine learning algorithms, statistical modelling and evaluation metrics using scikit-learn.

### Data Science Intern
###### Jun '19 - Sep '19
Researched on slot-filling techniques and developed a machine learning application by tweaking Stanford's Universal Dependency Parser.

Developed internal preprocessing modules in a chatbot.

Experimented different neural networks on entity tagging to capture user intention on chat data.

## HKT
### Web Programmer Intern
###### Feb '18 – Jul '18
Developed a dashboard web application with ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET WebAPI for a CRM software. Deployed the web application to IIS Server.

Researched on machine learning use cases in telecommunication company. Introduced to Speech-to-Text Conversion by Google and discussed with manager about my findings.

Setup a LAMP stack without an all-in-one solution (e.g. XAMPP) in a Virtual Machine to backup data from IIS Server every several minutes (using crontab). Learned how to deal with problems when there are incompatibility in the LAMP stack.

Created an application to convert .wav file into binary data, which enables voice data storage. Learned different attributes in a .wav file (encoding, sample rates) and compression techniques (lossless and lossy compression).

## TEDx HKPolyU
### Head of Information Technology
###### Aug '17 – Jun '19
Designed and developed landing pages for TEDx events. Integrated the website with Facebook Analytics for advertisements and lead conversion.

Developed a mobile application for video streaming and blog sharing services. [Link to GitHub.](https://www.github.com/jackyangara/tedxhkpolyu) Learned how important data storage is, whether it is stored locally in the machine or in the database, reducing unnecessary overhead.

Managed team members while ensuring both individual and team growth. Being assigned as the head, I have to handle my teammates to collaborate to complete the task, while also giving an important lesson to my teammates (both are my juniors in the university) on what to work with. In a team of three, I appointed each of them to deal with the frontend and the backend while I monitor the progress and give feedbacks on what to do next.
