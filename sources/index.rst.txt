Hi there
============================

My name is Jacky Angara. I was born and raised in |:indonesia:| , got my Bachelor's degree in |:hong_kong:| , and currently working in |:singapore:| .

You got all the flags?

Why Sphinx? |:cat2:|
--------------------
I chose Sphinx to create this website for several reasons:

1. Documentations are important, I have to start doing it. You have to start doing it too.
2. I'm only displaying information here, nothing more. Sphinx is great in creating this boilerplates.
3. After compiling ReST/MD files, I still can change the HTML codes. Which is very convenient
4. There is an elegant search bar on the top-left corner (depends on your screen size, but you know what I mean).
5. You can easily change templates. I'm currently using sphinx_rtd_theme a.k.a. the most beautiful Sphinx theme.
6. It's beautiful. Again. I like this theme a lot.
7. It's simple. Very simple, to be honest.

How simple you may ask?

Click "View page source" on the top-right corner to see how simple this is. It contains the ReST/MD files that are being converted into these HTML sites.
It does not restrict my freedom because HTML files are not that deeply stored inside the folders nor is it messy.

Enough about Sphinx, more about me. Click next button down below or jump to any contents from the sidebar.
To come back here, click on the |:house:| icon at the top, beside my name.
